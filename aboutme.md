Hi, my name is Abhishek and I am an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Information and Technology, Gwalior and pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology.

I am good at developing native android apps and enthusiastically learning newer tools to improve my proficiency.
Currently learning to build multi-platform apps.
I love watching my codes work, it's oddly satisfying. I am skilled in Java, C++, Python, R and Kotlin.

The [projects](https://sudoabhi.github.io/projects) page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also take a look at my (somewhat outdated) [resume](https://sudoabhi.github.io/resume).
I am also involved in a lot of organizational works related to clubs, fests and workshops, I helped reviving my institute's robotics' club and co-founded the drama club of my college from scratch. 

I am aspiring to be an entrepreneur. I believe I can solve people's problems and bring in a change to make stuff easier.

Okay, here are my not-so-boring qualities that I love to flaunt about 
- I rock at creating awesome stuff. I am a quick learner. &#128521;
- When I am not coding, I can either be found singing(terribly) or pondering over fascinating things like astrophysics.
- You can't beat me at chess. Or can you?
- Love daydreaming.
- I love video games, movies, literature and more.
- I'm a crazy fan of iron man.

% When I'm not brainstorming ideas or furiously typing away, you'll find me reading, geeking out about cool tech, or researching my latest obsession (UI/UX, consumer psychology, venture capital, to name a few).
This website is my digital garden â€” a compendium of the things I've learned and created over the years. %

If any of these things intrigue you, don't hesitate to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudoabhi/ "Abhishek Kumar") or [e-mail](mailto:abhishek2606@hotmail.com) me.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, but Google would one day answer **all** your questions.
